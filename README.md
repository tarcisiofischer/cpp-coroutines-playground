Notes and experiments for C++20 Coroutines
===

C++ coroutines have been available for a while.
There's plenty of resources out there, so I wanted to give it a try.
This repo is a set of experiments, tests and resources about it.

### Useful resources

- [cppreference](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/coroutines)
- [cppreference on coroutine_handle](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/coroutine/coroutine_handle)
- [David Mazières' Tutorial (2021)](https://www.scs.stanford.edu/~dm/blog/c++-coroutines.html)
- [Lewis Baker's Blog Series (2017-2018)](https://lewissbaker.github.io/)
- [Mateusz Pusz's mp-coro](https://github.com/mpusz/mp-coro/tree/main): Unfortunately I only found out about this one after I started my work in this repo. Very good resource to hack while learning CPP20 coroutines.
